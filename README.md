# ReachablePointInSpaceCalculator

This project was made as part of my MTE-204 Course in 2017. My incentive to create this project was due to the slow run time of MATLAB, I was waiting over 24 hours, to execute similar code. Unfortunately, I am unable to upload said scripts as they related closely to a course project that has been repeated through the years. This program reduced my runtime to less than 30 seconds at the time of writing it and allowed for a wide variety of tests to be run and discussed in the report.
